Lumber uses your SQL or MongoDB database to generates a modern Admin Interface (see the live demo) (see the [live demo](https://app.forestadmin.com/login?livedemo)) that is completely **backend agnostic** and highly flexible.

Lumber has been designed with scalability in mind to fit requirements from **small projects** to **mature companies**.
