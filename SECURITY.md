# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use the [Forest Admin community forum](https://community.forestadmin.com) and create a new "security" post.
Our technical team will consider your request carefully.

If the vulnerability report is accepted, Forest Admin will:
- work on a fix of the current version with the highest priority,
- let you know as soon as a new patch version is published.
